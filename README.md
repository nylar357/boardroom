The Family Crypto Fund

This is all going to seem very official and stringent guys just because im trying to give us a framework to go off of, but keep in mind that this is anything but formal.  This fund can and SHOULD adapt over time as we learn more about investing in crypto and working with each other.  Also this is first and foremost for FUN, to be FAMILY TOGETHER, being CONSTRUCTIVE with each other.  HOWEVER we are dealing with each and every persons money, and we can possible make A LOT of money.  So we will take measures to assure we're not taking HUGE hits.  

There is now the USDCoin and USDTether coin both are backed by the Federal Reserve and always value at 1$ with a pennys worth of flucuation built in.  USDC even has a 3% APR gaurenteed by the Federal Reserve.



 
Section I : Coin Holder Rights & Rules

The family unit will act as a board of members with buy/sell/trade power
in comparative coin holding amounts.  Each member recieving a single 1. Voting Value
plus their standing in the family unit itself.  Patriarch & Matriarchs recieve 1/2 
of one Voting Value per child plus 1/2 VV if they are the Patriarch/Matriarch in 
their family unit.  This Pat/Matr additional value can only apply once per person.
A mother cannot get 1/2 value for being the mother of children and another 1/2 for 
being the Matriarch of the whole family.

Section II: Voting
Example:

Sally:
Matriarch:1/2
3XChildren:1 1/2
Coin Share: 1

VV: 3

But she could however NOT recieve 
Matriarch of household: 1/2
Matriarch of Family: 1/2

Section III: Definitions
1. Voting Value Defined:

The voting value of each member will be averaged based on all participants total
voting values (whole of the board) this average will reflect the % of the total 
2.USD$ Pool being invested as they see fit.  Voting Values only come into play with 
a highly divided Board.  

2. USD$ Pool / Total currency invested family-wise.  This pool is then divided in half.  One half will initiate in 3.NON-STAKED coins, the other half will be exclusively invested in 4.STAKED coins.  

3./4. STAKING is a system which the coins invested
recieve full Market Gains/Losses + a set APR (usually paid monthly), STAKED coins 
cannot be actively traded or sold without taking a penelty.  STAKING on the systems
side acts as the liquidity foundation, so coins that are STAKED recieve very good
APR but they USUALLY cannot be traded or sold readily without taking peneltys.


EXAMPLE VOTES:
So to try to keep this short I will give a simple example as a guideline for us to go forward:

USD$ POOL : 500$ USD
MEMBERS/Voting Value:
Sally/3
Zach/1
Bob/2
Dax/2
Harlie/1
Pierce/1

250$ (STAKED) our choices are Ethereum, HEX, Litecoin
Sally Votes:ETHereum
Zach Votes:ETH
BOB:HEX
Dax:HEX
Harlie:LiteCOIN
Pierce:Litecoin

ETH - 4
HEX - 4
LTC - 2

10 total VV so we simply take $250, percentaged and averaged makes an easy 25$ per
vote.  100$ ETH Stake 100$ HEX Stake 50$ LTC Stake


MOSTLY USELESS THOUGHTS WITH SOME GOOD INFO IN THERE:

Non-Staked coins will adhere to the same voting system.  Its encouraged each member should familiarize themselves with the predetermined coins.  Depending on the time basis we meet to add $ to the pool, trade, sell, THE MEETING PRIOR the
board will decide on several coins to keep an eye on and the coins OF THOSE PREVIOUSLY CHOSEN will then make-up our selections going forward.  IF YOU CHOOSE
TO BRING TO THE BOARD A COIN WHICH WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AND THE BOARD
GIVEN TIME TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH IT, YOU SHOULD BRING TO THE BOARD A
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION REFLECTING THE PROS/CONS AND MARKET HISTORY 

If you guys think this is something you'd like to be interested in let me know.  This can be discussed further but anyone can join at any time, bringing at least 25$ to the pool, I currently have about 250$ in diversified crypto I am willing to bring to the family pool righ now.  But we can all start with 20$ or $25.  Then
decide going forward to add 5$ or 10$ per meeting per person.  Should you decide
as I am to put fourth a larger amount, realize you gain NO VOTING VALUE beyond what the system allows or the board decides going forward.  HOWEVER IF A BOARD MEMBER SHOULD DO SO THEY WILL BE GIVEN PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION IF THEY COME TO THE BOARD WITH A INFORMED PROPOSAL.  For example :

"Hey guys I'm going to put in 100$ this month bc I know this new coin is being released OR I have some information that would lead me to believe this is happening and investing a portion into futures and shorting a coin would be profitable.

There is also the system of Staking which i will define later, but this is a system in which you can buy stable coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum and lock them down for set periods of time, in that time you cannot trade or sell them without penelty but you recieve APR's of 18% up to weekly Rates paid out based upon the market shares and performance.  What I'm saying here is there is ample choices to ensure were not losing money, ever, I've now invested over 1000$ in crypto over the last year and I have never taken a loss in the end.  

March 24th I invested 220$ last night May 17th I cashed that out into almost 600$, and that is without Staking and without a single trade or swap.  This can be as active as we would like or as hands off, the options are there all we have to do is decide.  

As for the account or "Wallet" as it is called in the world of crypto, this can be purly digital or it is possible to buy a small piece of hardware (think a fitbit) and this piece of hardware acts as a true digital wallet.  If the wallet is lost digital or physical the money is lost.  Wallets are represented by a 32 character alphanumeric string.  Wallets can hold any variety and number of different coins but WALLET ADDRESS' (that is the address you enter when buying or trading coins) are COIN SPECIFIC, this is important to remember.  In our wallet we will have a different address for each type of coin.  Functionally this is rarely something you have to think or worry about as most apps take care of this kind of thing for you, but ANYTIME YOUR recieving coins, sending coins, that is moving coin as is, NOT CONVERTING TO USD$; there is a specific wallet code for that type of coin.  This isnt something probably any of you will have to worry or work with but it is something you should remember.  Sending or Recieve to the wrong address means your MONEY IS GONE, AND IS UNRECOVERABLE.
