Having a crypto Wallet is totally up to you, the Fund will have its own.  Simply sending your money digitally to the sender will be enough for us to get it into the fund.  My hopes however are that you actually take an interest and learn as we go and realize that CryptoCurrency offers us as people living today a level of freedom and opportunity.  The freedom to mold your financial independence & world facing monetary risk.  That is you can totally anonymously invest where you see fit, anytime, any amount totally independant of ANY INSTITUTION.  There is a level of Risk which is balance by Knowledge & EXPERIENCE which is exactly what this little experiement is giving all of us!

App/Wallets I would reccommend : 

A few things to remember:

Identity Confirmation, if you can't confirm you ID which is usually done with phone pictures of your Driver Liscence; you cannot Cash Out coins, buy coins, convert coin, or transfer funds.  You can however recieve them if they're sent from another wallet.

It would be a good idea to create a burner checking account online, the way I've found to work best is this:

CRYPTO.COM APP : Crypto.com app & website offers a SEMI-FULL exchange with wallet access.  Verfication here was the smoothest I experienced.

Bitmart : Bitmart App & Website is the first FULL-EXCHANGE that offered flawless verfication and good fees.

CoinGecko : Another good FULL-EXCHANGE & Wallet

Coinbase : Probably the most well known and best functioning wallet/exchange out there, but the identity verfication process can be problematic.  At least it has been for me.  


Cashapp : being used to easily transfer money person to person and into banks and cards.  Cashapp however cannot be used to fund Wallets or buy coin, you'll need a bank account.  But I've found an APP available on Apple and Android:
DAVE : yes its called Dave, its a banking app and I use it exclusively in conjunction with Cashapp.  I move money from cashapp into my Dave account and then fortuately the Dave accounts are accepted at all major Wallets/Apps.  If you dont mind using your Bank account go for it.  MOST wallets/exchange apps are extremely secure and offer some of the best security options within those accounts.  I simply use these accounts in this way as to have them airgapped from my real life.  Crypto is untraceable and annonymous, so it affords you many things a normal currency doesn't but as we evolve this fun little experiement we may go thru several wallets & exchanges and I personally wouldnt want my bank account tied to 4 or 5 different wallet/exchanges all possibly effecting your bank and thus your REAL LIFE.  So my advise GET "CASHAPP" GET "DAVE".  USE CASHAPP TO FUNNEL $ INTO THE DAVE ACCOUNT AND THEN USE THE DAVE ACCOUNT TO FUND YOUR CRYPTO

HOWEVER OUR FUND WILL ALL HAVE ITS OWN WALLET & EXCHANGES SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO HAVE A PERSONAL ONE.  

EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDS WALLET ACCOUNTS WILL BE GIVEN TO A SINGLE MEMEBER OF THE BOARD VOTED IN BY MAJORITY.  THE WALLET WILL BE SETUP SO THAT PERSON ALONE RECIEVES 2 VERFICATION STEPS BEFORE THE ACCOUNT CAN BE LOGGED INTO.  YOU RECIEVE A CODE BY TEXT THEN A VERFICATION EMAIL.  SO NO ONE BUT THE TREASURER EVER HAS CONSTANT ACCESS TO THE WALLET.  IT SHOULD BE SAID HOWEVER THAT STARTING OUT WITH THIS YOU WILL ALL PROBABLY NEED HELP AND ANY ONE OF US MAY AT SOME POINT LOG INTO THE WALLET TO HELP WITH SOME ISSUE OR TO DO MAINTAINENCE ON THE ACCOUNT.  IF YOU HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THIS, WELL A. YOU SHOULDNT LOL AND B. SORRY THE IDEA IS SECURE TRANSPARENCY.  DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY SCREENSHOTS OF OUR FUNDS AND WALLETS WILL BE PROVIDED.
